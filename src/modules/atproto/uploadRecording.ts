 * Put an audio file in the author's PDS and return the at-uri of the record.
 *
 * With an `rkey`, putRecord writes the recording at the note's own rkey — that
 * shared rkey *is* the attachment, the only thing that says this audio belongs to
 * that note. Overwriting is the wanted behaviour: a second cut of an episode
 * replaces the first rather than leaving two recordings and no way to tell which
 * one the note means. Without an rkey there is no note to attach to, so
 * createRecord takes a PDS-assigned TID and the caller falls back to pasting the
 * markdown link.
 *
 * The record is written immediately after the upload on purpose: an
 * unreferenced blob is temporary and gets garbage collected, with roughly an
 * hour of grace. The reference cannot wait for the publish cycle.
 *
 * A failed upload leaves nothing behind; a failed write leaves an orphan
 * blob that the PDS collects on its own.
